# Robot
Robot created using mostly CSS/CSS3

Originally created a Robot on the Dash Website - however I then tweaked what I had done on that course to make my robot more personalised to me.

I changed it so instead of flashing eyes, my robot had a beating heart, that it could move left to right, and that the background colour would keep changing on a loop.
